# Lazy Acid: Arduino Nano-based random bassline generator for modular synths

This is a cutdown version of my Arduino Nano-based, MIDI, quantised, polyphonic step sequencer. 

It generates a random 16-step bassline quantised to scale and 1/16th to 1/2 notes, and outputs pitch CV, trigger CV, and 2PPQN clock. 

It also accepts 2PPQN clock in and will start/stop (and reset on stop) with the external clock. 

Features: 

You can set: 

    Root note (C to B)
    Mode
        Major
        Lydian
        Mixolydian
        Minor
        Dorian
        Phyrigian
        Chromatic
    BPM

There's a start/stop switch, a generator switch, and a clock mode switch.
